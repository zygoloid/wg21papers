DRAFT 1839: look up until we get to innermost enclosing namespace. if you don't find a member of the innermost enclosing namespace, ill-formed.

DRAFT 1705: strike "for all types", "for any type", replace "other" with "parameter", name the templates in the final two sentences and talk about the types directly rather than weaseling with "for all types being considered".

DRAFT 1590: trivially copyable means has >=1 trivial copy or move, and a trivial dtor. extra copy is possible for trivially copyable classes. deleted special member is nontrivial (1928).
DRAFT 1936: 14.5.6.1/5 should apply here, but don't make this a dependent name (that means we do ADL stuff). update 14.6.4 to indicate that members of unknown specializations are not bound early.

allow default construction of no-capture lambdas

"You gotta know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when you need parens
and know when you need none

You never count your sizeof
When your type is dependent
There'll be plenty of time for counting
When substitution's done"

<h1>Wording for guaranteed copy elision through simplified value categories</h1>

This paper provides wording for <a href="http://wg21.link/p0135r0">P0135R0</a>.

<p>This also resolves the following core issues:<br>
<a href="http://wg21.link/cwg1565">1565</a>: Copy elision and lifetime of <tt>initializer_list</tt> underlying array<br>
<a href="http://wg21.link/cwg1590">1590</a>: Bypassing non-copy/move constructor copying<br>
<a href="http://wg21.link/cwg1599">1599</a>: Lifetime of <tt>initializer_list</tt> underlying array<br>
<a href="http://wg21.link/cwg1697">1697</a>: Lifetime extension and copy elision<br>
<a href="http://wg21.link/cwg2022">2022</a> [PARTIAL]: Copy elision in constant expressions (except for NRVO)<br>

<p>Change in 3.10 [basic.lval] paragraph 1:

<blockquote>
Expressions are categorized according to the taxonomy in Figure 1. [Figure 1: Expression category taxonomy]

<ul>
  <li><del>An <i>lvalue</i> [&hellip;]</del>
  <li><del>[&hellip;]</del>
  <li><del>A <i>prvalue</i>[&hellip;]</del>
  <li><ins>A <i>glvalue</i> is an expression whose evaluation computes the location of an object, bit-field, or function.</ins>
  <li><ins>A <i>prvalue</i> is an expression whose evaluation initializes an object, bit-field, or the operand of an operator, as specified by the context in which it appears.</ins>
  <li><ins>An <i>xvalue</i> is a glvalue that denotes an object or
      bit-field whose resources can be reused (usually because it is near the
      end of its lifetime). [&nbsp;<em>Example</em>: Certain kinds of expressions
      involving rvalue references (8.3.2) yield xvalues, such as a call to a function whose
      return type is an rvalue reference or a cast to an rvalue reference type.&nbsp;]</ins>
  <li><ins>An <i>lvalue</i> is a glvalue that is not an xvalue.</ins>
  <li><ins>An <i>rvalue</i> is a prvalue or an xvalue.</ins>
</ul>

<ins>[&nbsp;<em>Note</em>:
Historically, lvalues and rvalues were so-called because
they could appear on the left- and right-hand side of an
assignment (although this is no longer generally true);
glvalues are "generalized" lvalues,
prvalues are "pure" rvalues,
and xvalues are "eXpiring" lvalues.
Despite their names, these terms classify expressions, not values.
]</ins>

Every expression belongs to exactly one of the fundamental classifications in this taxonomy: lvalue, xvalue, or prvalue. This property of an expression is called its <em>value category</em>. [&hellip;]
</blockquote>

<p>Add a new paragraph after 3.10 [basic.lval] paragraph 1:

<blockquote class="stdins">
The <em>result</em> of a prvalue is the value that the expression stores into
its context. The <em>result object</em> of a prvalue
is the object initialized by the prvalue. A prvalue whose result is the value
<tt>V</tt> is sometimes said to have or name the value <tt>V</tt>.
Because there are no objects of type <tt>void</tt>, a prvalue of type
(possibly cv-qualified) <tt>void</tt> has no result object.
[&nbsp;<em>Note</em>:
Except when the prvalue is the operand of a <em>decltype-specifier</em>,
a prvalue of class or array type always has a result object.
For a discarded prvalue, a temporary object is materialized; see [expr].
]
The <em>result</em> of a glvalue is the entity denoted by the expression.
</blockquote>

<p>Change in 3.10 [basic.lval] paragraph 2:

<blockquote>
<ins>[&nbsp;<em>Note</em>:</ins>
Whenever a glvalue appears in a context where a prvalue is expected, the
glvalue is converted to a prvalue; see 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.
<ins>]</ins>

<blockquote class="stdins">
[&nbsp;<em>Note</em>:
Whenever a prvalue appears in a context where an xvalue or glvalue is expected,
the prvalue is converted to an xvalue; see [conv.rval].
]
</blockquote>

<p>Delete 3.10 [basic.lval] paragraphs 5 - 8 and change in paragraph 9:

<blockquote>
<del>If an expression can be used to modify the object to which it refers, the expression is called modifiable.</del>
An lvalue is <em>modifiable</em> unless its type is <tt>const</tt>-qualified or is a function type.
<ins>[&nbsp;<em>Note</em>:</ins>
A program that attempts to modify an object through a nonmodifiable lvalue <ins>expression</ins> or
<ins>through an</ins> rvalue expression is ill-formed ([expr.ass], [expr.post.inc], [expr.pre.inc]).
<ins>]</ins>
</blockquote>

<!--
<p>Change in 4 [conv] paragraph 1:

<blockquote>
Standard conversions are implicit conversions with built-in meaning. Clause 4 enumerates the full set of such
conversions. A standard conversion sequence is a sequence of standard conversions in the following order:
<ul>
<li>
 Zero or one conversion from the following set: lvalue-to-rvalue conversion, array-to-pointer conversion,
 <del>and</del> function-to-pointer conversion<ins>, and temporary materialization conversion</ins>.
<li>
 Zero or one conversion from the following set: integral promotions, floating point promotion, integral
 conversions, floating point conversions, floating-integral conversions, pointer conversions, pointer to
 member conversions, and boolean conversions.
<li>
 Zero or one function pointer conversion.
<li>
  Zero or one qualification conversion.
</ul>
[&nbsp;<em>Note</em>:
A standard conversion sequence can be empty, i.e., it can consist of no conversions.
A temporary materialization conversion cannot be combined with any other conversion, as all
later conversions act only on prvalues.
]
A standard conversion sequence will be applied to an expression if necessary to convert it to a required
destination type <ins>and value category</ins>.
</blockquote>
-->

<p>Change in 4.1 [conv.lval] paragraph 1, second footnote (footnote 55):

<blockquote>
In C++ class <ins>and array</ins> prvalues can have cv-qualified types<del>
(because they are objects)</del>. This differs from ISO C, in which
non-lvalues never have cv-qualified types.
</blockquote>

<p>Change in 4.1 [conv.lval] paragraph 2:

<blockquote>
When an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to an expression <tt>e</tt>, and [&hellip;] the value contained in the referenced object is not accessed.
[&nbsp;<em>Example</em>: &hellip;&nbsp;] <del>In all other cases,</del> The result of the conversion is determined according to the following rules:
<ul>
<li>If T is (possibly cv-qualified) std::nullptr_t, the result is a null pointer constant (4.10).
<li>Otherwise, if T has a class type, the conversion copy-initializes <del>a temporary of type T</del> <ins>the result object</ins> from the glvalue
    <del>and the result of the conversion is a prvalue for the temporary</del>.
<li>Otherwise, if the object to which the glvalue refers contains an invalid pointer value (3.7.4.2, 3.7.4.3),
    the behavior is implementation-defined.
<li>Otherwise, the value contained in the object indicated by the glvalue is the prvalue result.
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Change in 4.2 [conv.array] paragraph 1:

<blockquote>
  An lvalue or rvalue of type "array of N T"
  or "array of unknown bound of T"
  can be converted to a prvalue of type "pointer to T".
  <ins>The temporary materialization conversion ([conv.rval]) is applied.</ins>
  The result is a pointer to the first element of the array.
</blockquote>

<p>Add a new subclause after 4.3:

<blockquote class="stdins">
<h2>4.4 Temporary materialization conversion [conv.rval]</h2>
<p>A prvalue of type <tt>T</tt> can be converted to an xvalue of type
<tt>T</tt>. This conversion initializes a temporary object ([class.temporary])
of type <tt>T</tt> from the prvalue
by evaluating the prvalue with the temporary object as its result object,
and produces an xvalue denoting the
temporary object. <tt>T</tt> shall be a complete type. If <tt>T</tt> is
a class type (or array thereof), the destructor is invoked implicitly
([class.dtor]).
[&nbsp;<em>Example</em>:
<pre>struct X { int n; }
int k = X().n; // ok, X() prvalue is converted to xvalue
</pre>
]
</blockquote>

<p>Add a new paragraph after 5 [expr] paragraph 9 ("Whenever a glvalue expressions as an operand of an operator that expects a prvalue"):

<blockquote class="stdins">
Whenever an rvalue expression appears as an operand of an operator that expects
a glvalue for that operand, the temporary materialization
conversion ([conv.rval]) is applied to convert the expression to an xvalue.
</blockquote>

<p>Change in 5 [expr] paragraph 11:

<blockquote>
In some contexts, an expression only appears for its side effects.
Such an expression is called a <em>discarded-value expression</em>.
<del>The expression is evaluated and its value is discarded.</del>
The array-to-pointer (4.2) and function-to-pointer (4.3) standard conversions are not applied.
The lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (4.1) is applied if and
only if the expression is a glvalue of
<del>volatile-qualified</del> type <ins><tt>volatile T</tt></ins>
and it is one of the following:
[&hellip;]
[&nbsp;<em>Note</em>: Using an overloaded operator causes a function call; the above covers only operators with built-in
meaning. <ins>&nbsp;]
If the expression is a prvalue after this optional conversion,
the temporary materialization conversion ([temp.rval]) is applied.
[&nbsp;<em>Note</em>:</ins>
If the <ins>expression is an</ins> lvalue <del>is</del> of class type, it must
have a volatile copy constructor to initialize the temporary that is the result
<ins>object</ins> of the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion. ]
<ins>The glvalue expression is evaluated and its value is discarded.</ins>
</blockquote>

<em>Drafting note: it is no longer meaningful to evaluate a prvalue expression
of class or array type without specifying an object to initialize from it, as
the prvalue does not itself create such an object.</em>

<p>Change in 5.1.2 [expr.prim.lambda] paragraph 2:

<blockquote>
The evaluation of a <em>lambda-expression</em> results in a prvalue <del>temporary (12.2). This temporary is</del> <ins>whose result object is</ins> called the <em>closure object</em>. [&hellip;]

<p>Change in 5.2.1 [expr.sub] paragraph 1:

[&hellip;] in the case of an array operand, the result is an lvalue if that operand is an lvalue and an xvalue otherwise.
<!--
[&hellip;] in the case of an array operand, the result <del>is an lvalue if that operand is an lvalue and an xvalue otherwise</del> <ins>has the same value category as the array operand</ins>.

<p>Change in 5.2.2 [expr.call] paragraph 4:

<blockquote>
[&hellip;]
<del>

<p>Change in 5.2.2 [expr.call] paragraph 11:

<!-- FIXME: Move to description of decltype. -->

<em>Drafting note: if we select a constructor, we next visit the new bullet
above and are done. If we select a conversion function, the subsequent

type is the destination type or a derived class thereof, and we'll either
use the result directly (if it's a prvalue of the right type) or call a
constructor next.</em>

<!-- The idea: we actually just want to implicitly convert to cv1 T1.
But if that conversion uses a conversion function, we want to apply some
restrictions to its result type. So we perform just that one part of
the copy-initialization rules and then recurse back to this section to
do the rest.

The first alternative attempted to use the same recursion pattern for the
case where we're not going to use a conversion function, but that fails for
binding a reference to a bit-field, where we need to explicitly create a
temporary to avoid infinite recursion. The second alternative more directly
expresses the intent. -->

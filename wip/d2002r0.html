<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This paper provides a collection of wording fixes to improve the precision,
implementability, consistency, and completeness of the wording for defaulted
comparison operator functions.

<p>
In the following areas, there was previously no specification for how
a defaulted comparison operator behaves:

<ul>
<li>when it is implicitly defined (eagerly vs lazily);
<li>whether it is implicitly <tt>constexpr</tt>;
<li>when it may be explicitly declared <tt>constexpr</tt> or <tt>consteval</tt>.
</ul>

In each case, the new specification matches the behavior of
defaulted special member functions to the extent possible.

<p>
The rules for when to delete a comparison function were inconsistent
and varied between checks that overload resolution finds a usable function
and checks that require performing full semantic analysis on the definition
and determining whether it would be ill-formed.
Consistent with defaulted special member functions, we now look only for
surface-level problems: cases where overload resolution would fail
or the structure of the class is obviously incompatible with
a defaulted comparison (eg, reference members).

<p>
When determining whether a defaulted comparison is <tt>noexcept</tt>,
we now consider all operations it performs,
not only the invocation of comparison functions in its body.
This is consistent with the behavior of defaulted special member functions,
and avoids calls to <tt>terminate()</tt> if (for example)
a conversion performed when initializing a parameter of
a conversion function call throws an exception.

<p>
The specification for an implicitly-declared <tt>operator==</tt>
was incomplete, lacking specification for various properties of
the implicit declaration. Following prior CWG discussion, we
inherit all properties of the <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt> onto the
<tt>operator==</tt> (other than the name and return type).

<p>
In addition, the rules for the defaulted operators other than
<tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> and <tt>==</tt>
have been simplified and made to match the design intent,
that they capture the behavior of a rewritten operator
as a function whose address can be taken.
For those operators, we no longer care what members the class has,
since that plays no role in how the function is defaulted.

<h2>Wording</h2>

<p>
Change in 7.6.8 [expr.spaceship] paragraph 6:
</p>

<blockquote>
If at least one of the operands is of pointer type
<ins>and the other operand is of pointer or array type</ins>,
array-to-pointer conversions (7.3.2),
pointer conversions (7.3.11),
<del>function pointer conversions (7.3.13),</del>
and qualification conversions (7.3.5)
are performed on both operands to bring them to their composite pointer type (7.2.2).
<del>If at least one of the operands is of pointer-to-member type,
pointer-to-member conversions (7.3.12)
and qualification conversions (7.3.5)
are performed on both operands to bring them to their composite pointer type (7.2.2).
If both operands are null pointer constants, but not both of integer type,
pointer conversions (7.3.11)
are performed on both operands to bring them to their composite pointer type (7.2.2).
In all cases, after</del>
<ins>After</ins> the conversions, the operands shall have the same type.
[<i>Note</i>:
If both of the operands are arrays, array-to-pointer conversions (7.3.2) are not applied.
&mdash;<i>end note</i>]
</blockquote>

<i>
Drafting note: this extends the resolution of DR 583 to three-way comparisons,
and cleans up some dead wording left behind by the removal of <tt>std::*_equality</tt>.
The change to disallow three-way comparisons against null pointer constants
was approved by EWG as part of the discussion of P0946R0.
</i>

<p>
Change in 10.6 [module.context] paragraph 2:
</p>

<blockquote>
During the implicit definition of a defaulted <del>special member</del> function
(11.4.3<ins>, 11.11.1 [class.compare.default]</ins>),
the instantiation context is the union of
the instantiation context from the definition of the class and
the instantiation context of the program construct
that resulted in the implicit definition of the <ins>defaulted</ins> <del>special member</del> function.
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in 10.6 [module.context] paragraph 4:
</p>

<blockquote>
During the implicit instantiation of a template
that is implicitly instantiated
because it is referenced from within
the implicit definition of
a defaulted <del>special member</del> function,
the instantiation context is
the instantiation context of
the defaulted <del>special member</del> function.
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in 11.11.1 [class.compare.default] paragraph 1:
</p>

<blockquote>
A defaulted comparison operator function (12.6.2) for some class C shall be a non-template function
<del>declared</del> <ins>defined</ins> in the member-specification of C that is
<ul>
<li>
a non-static const <ins>non-volatile</ins> member of C having one parameter of type const C& <ins>and
either no <i>ref-qualifier</i> or the <i>ref-qualifier</i> <tt>&amp;</tt></ins>, or

<li>
a friend of C having either two parameters of type const C& or two parameters of type C.
</ul>
<ins>
A defaulted comparison operator function for class <tt>C</tt>
that is not defined as deleted
is <i>implicitly defined</i>
<!-- at the end of the definition of class <tt>C</tt>. -->
when it is odr-used or needed for constant evaluation.
Name lookups in the defaulted definition are performed from a context equivalent to
the <i>function-body</i> of the defaulted <tt>operator@</tt> function,
except that the defaulted function itself
is never a candidate for overload resolution.</ins>
</blockquote>

<i>Drafting note: the lazy definition of the defaulted function
needs to perform unqualified lookup for operator functions.
Such lookups should be done at the point where the function is defaulted,
in a manner analogous to two-phase name lookup for templates.
Lookups for a defaulted secondary operator function need to avoid
finding that secondary operator function itself.
</i>

<p>
<i>Drafting note: there is no need to require that
defaulted secondary operators be defaulted in their class
(or even that they have any particular parameter types).
Removing such restrictions seems like a design change
rather than a wording fix, so they are retained here.
</i>

<p>
Change in 11.11.1 [class.compare.default] paragraph 2:
</p>

<blockquote>
A defaulted <del>comparison</del> <ins><tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> or <tt>==</tt></ins> operator function
for class <tt>C</tt>
is defined as deleted if
any non-static data member of <tt>C</tt> is of reference type or
<tt>C</tt> <del>is a union-like class</del> <ins>has variant members</ins> (11.5.1).
</blockquote>

<i>Drafting note: it is not necessary to consider members when defaulting
a secondary comparison operator (<tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, ...)
in terms of a user-provided primary comparison operator.
Also, while variant members pose a problem for defaulted primary comparisons,
empty unions do not.</i>

<p>
Add a new paragraph after 11.11.1 [class.compare.default] paragraph 2:
</p>

<blockquote class="stdins">
A defaulted comparison function is <i>constexpr-compatible</i> if
it satisfies the requirements for a constexpr function ([dcl.constexpr]) and
no overload resolution performed when determining whether to delete the function
results in a usable candidate that is a non-constexpr function.
[<i>Note</i>:
This includes the overload resolutions performed:
<ul>
<li>
for an <tt>operator&lt=&gt;</tt> whose return type is not <tt>auto</tt>,
when determining whether a synthesized three-way comparison is defined,
<li>
for an <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt> whose return type is <tt>auto</tt>
or for an <tt>operator==</tt>,
for a comparison between an element of the expanded list of subobjects and itself,
or
<li>
for a secondary comparison operator <tt>@</tt>,
for the expression <tt>x @ y</tt>.
</ul>
&mdash;<i>end note</i>]
</blockquote>

<i>Drafting note: the implicit definition can invoke other functions, such as a conversion from
some custom comparison category to the return type, or an <tt>operator@</tt> if the use of the <tt>@</tt>
operator is rewritten in terms of a different operator. Ignoring those, and considering only
the results of overload resolutions that affect deletedness, is consistent with
the rule we use for defaulted special member functions. It doesn't really matter if we get this "wrong"
in a corner case, since the worst case is that a comparison function is spuriously constexpr.</i>

<p>
Change in 11.11.1 [class.compare.default] paragraph 4:
</p>

<blockquote>
[...]
<del>It is unspecified whether virtual base class subobjects
appear more than once in the expanded list of subobjects.</del>
</blockquote>

<p>
Add a new paragraph to the end of 11.4.3 [special]:
</p>

<blockquote class="stdins">
A defaulted special member function is <i>constexpr-compatible</i> if
it the corresponding implicitly-declared special member function
would be a constexpr function.
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in 9.5.2 [dcl.fct.def.default] paragraph 3:
<p>

<blockquote>
An explicitly-defaulted function that is not defined as deleted
may be declared constexpr or consteval
only if it <del>would have been</del> <ins>is</ins> <del>implicitly declared as</del>
constexpr<ins>-compatible ([special], [class.compare.default])</ins>.
If a <ins>constexpr-compatible</ins> function is explicitly defaulted on its first declaration,
it is implicitly considered to be constexpr <del>if the implicit declaration would be</del>.
</blockquote>

<i>Drafting note: this behavior seems unwise; consider a case such as:</i>

<pre>
constexpr bool operator==(const X&, const X&);
struct X { int n; friend bool operator==(const X&, const X&) = default; };
</pre>

<i>This program is valid, but reversing the order of the two lines renders it ill-formed
because the defaulted <tt>operator==</tt> is no longer <tt>constexpr</tt>.
Perhaps a better general rule would be that a constexpr-compatible defaulted function
is implicitly constexpr if it is defaulted at class scope, regardless of whether
that's the first declaration (that is, you always get an implicit <tt>constexpr</tt>
for a defaulted comparison)? The same concern applies to the implicit exception specification.
However, for a case such as:</i>

<pre>
struct Y { int &amp;n; friend bool operator==(const Y&, const Y&) = default; };
bool operator==(const Y&, const Y&);
</pre>

<i>
... the program will be ill-formed if we reverse the two lines
(because the <tt>operator==</tt> is deleted after its first declaration),
and there's not really anything we can do about that.
</i>

<p>
Change in 11.11.1 [class.compare.default] paragraph 3:
</p>

<blockquote>
If the <del>class definition</del> <ins><i>member-specification</i></ins>
does not explicitly declare
<del>an <tt>==</tt> operator function</del>
<ins>any member or friend named <tt>operator==</tt></ins>,
<del>but declares a defaulted three-way comparison operator function,</del>
an <tt>==</tt> operator function is declared implicitly
<ins>for each defaulted three-way comparison operator function
defined in the <i>member-specification</i>,</ins>
with the same access <ins>and <i>function-definition</i>
and in the same class scope</ins>
as the three-way comparison operator function<ins>,
except that the return type is replaced with <tt>bool</tt>
and the <i>declarator-id</i> is replaced with <tt>operator==</tt></ins>.
<ins>[<i>Note</i>: Such an</ins>
<del>The</del> implicitly-declared <tt>==</tt> operator for a class <tt>X</tt>
is an inline <del>member</del> <ins>function</ins> and
is defined as defaulted in the definition of <tt>X</tt><ins>,
and has the same
<i>parameter-declaration-clause</i> and
trailing <i>requires-clause</i> as the three-way comparison operator</ins>.
If the three-way comparison operator function is declared as
a non-static const member, the implicitly-declared <tt>==</tt> operator function is a <ins>non-static const</ins> member<ins>.</ins>
<del>of the form
<pre>
bool X::operator==(const X&) const;
</pre>
Otherwise,
</del>
<ins>If the three-way comparison operator function declaration is a friend declaration,</ins>
the implicitly-declared <tt>==</tt> operator function is

friend bool operator==(const X&, const X&);

<del>[<i>Note</i>: Such</del> <ins>such</ins> a friend function is visible to argument-dependent lookup only.
<ins>If the three-way comparison operator function is declared
<tt>virtual</tt>, <tt>constexpr</tt>, or <tt>consteval</tt>,
the implicitly-declared <tt>==</tt> operator function is declared
<tt>virtual</tt>, <tt>constexpr</tt>, or <tt>consteval</tt>,
respectively.</ins> &mdash;<i>end note</i>]

  // implicitly declares: friend constexpr bool operator==(X, X) requires (sizeof(T) != 1) = default;

  [[nodiscard]] virtual std::strong_ordering operator&lt;=&gt;(const X&amp;) const = default;
  // implicitly declares: [[nodiscard]] virtual bool operator==(const X&amp;) const = default;
};
</pre>
&mdash;<i>end example</i>]</ins>
<del>The operator is a <tt>constexpr</tt> function if its definition would satisfy the requirements for a <tt>constexpr</tt> function.</del>
[<i>Note</i>: The <tt>==</tt> operator function is declared implicitly even if the defaulted three-way comparison operator function is defined as deleted. &mdash;<i>end note</i>]
</blockquote>

<i>Drafting note: there can be more than one defaulted three-way comparison,
and we previously agreed to produce a defaulted <tt>operator==</tt> for each.
The old wording didn't specify many of the properties of the <tt>operator==</tt>
function; inheriting them all from the <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt> function
seems like the right default behavior.</i>

<h2>Changes since N4429</h2>

<ul>
  <li>in 7.3.3p15, don't restrict the set of inherited members</li>
  <li>in 7.3.3.p17, make explicit that no access check is performed in "<tt>using Base::Base;</tt>"</li>
  <li>in 7.3.3.p18, make it clearer that the accessibility of the base class is not considered when using a constructor inherited from a base class</li>
  <li>in 12.6.3.p1, make it clearer that we don't default-initialize the chosen base class</li>
  <li>in 12.6.3.p2, give a more complex example showing the Y != X case</li>
  <li>in 12.6.3, directly initialize the class from which the constructor was originally inherited rather than proceeding recursively, and clarify that parameter initialization is sequenced before subobject initialization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
There are a number of active core issues relating to inheriting constructors,
with a single common theme: an inheriting constructor does not act like any
other form of <em>using-declaration</em>. The reason for this is that all other
<em>using-declaration</em>s make some set of declarations visible to name lookup
in another context, but an inheriting constructor declaration declares a new
constructor (or set thereof) that merely delegates to the original.

<p>
After some discussion in CWG, it is believed that these issues can all be
resolved by changing the meaning of an inheriting constructor declaration from
declaring a set of new constructors, to making a set of base class constructors
visible in a derived class <em>as if</em> they were derived class constructors.
(When such a constructor is used, the additional derived class subobjects will
also be implicitly constructed as if by a defaulted default constructor.)
Put another way:
<strong>this proposal makes inheriting a constructor act just like
inheriting any other base class member, to the extent possible</strong>.

<p>
This change does affect the meaning and validity of some programs, but
these changes improve the consistency and comprehensibility of C++. CWG
wishes to treat this change as a DR against C++11.

<h2>Examples of behavior changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>SFINAE on inheriting constructors now works reliably
<pre>
struct A {
  template&lt;typename T> A(T, typename enable_if&lt;sizeof(T) == 4, int>::type = 0);
};
struct B : A {
  using A::A; // formerly declared
              //   #1: B(T)
              //   #2: B(T, typename enable_if&lt;...>::type)
              // now makes A::A(T, typename enable_if&lt;...>::type = 0)
              // visible as a constructor of B
  B(...);
};
B b(123ull);  // now ok; used to ignore SFINAE condition and select inherited constructor #1
</pre>

<li>Hiding works the same as for other member <em>using-declarations</em> in the presence of default arguments
<pre>
struct A {
  A(int a, int b = 0);
  void f(int a, int b = 0);
};
struct B : A {
  B(int a);      using A::A;
  void f(int a); using A::f;
};
struct C : A {
  C(int a, int b = 0);      using A::A;
  void f(int a, int b = 0); using A::f;
};

B b(0); // was ok, now ambiguous
b.f(0); // ambiguous (unchanged)

C c(0); // was ambiguous, now ok
c.f(0); // ok (unchanged)
</pre>

<li>Inheriting constructor parameters are no longer copied
<pre>
struct A { A(const A&amp;) = delete; A(int); };
struct B { B(A); void f(A); };
struct C : B { using B::B; using B::f; };
C c({0}); // was ill-formed, now ok (no copy made)
c.f({0}); // ok (unchanged)
</pre>

<li>Ellipsis parameters used to be unimplementable on some ABIs
<pre>
struct A { A(const char *, ...); };
struct B : A { using A::A; };
B b("%d %d", 1, 2); // ok, now implementable
</pre>

<li>Access check now exactly matches the base class member
<pre>
class A {
public:
  template&lt;typename T> A(T, typename T::type);
private:
  A(int);
  friend void f();
};
class B {
  typedef int type;
  friend class A;
};
struct C : A {
  using A::A;
};

void f() {
  A a1(B(), 0); // ok (unchanged)
  C c1(B(), 0); // was ill-formed (implicit C constructor can't access B::type), now ok

  A a2(42); // ok (unchanged, f is a friend)
  C c2(42); // was ill-formed (implicit C constructor can't access A constructor), now ok
}
C c3(123); // still ill-formed, no access to A(int) constructor
</pre>
This access behavior differs from that of a normal member
<em>using-declaration</em>,
but matches the existing design of inheriting constructors.
</ul>

<h2>Proposed wording</h2>

<p>
Remove 12.9 class.inhctor, "Inheriting constructors".
</p>

<p>
Change in 3.9 basic.types paragraph 10:
</p>
<blockquote>
A type is a <em>literal type</em> if it is:
<ul><li>&hellip;
    <li>a class type (Clause 9) that has all of the following properties:
      <ul><li>&hellip;

              at least one <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor or constructor template
              <ins>(possibly inherited (7.3.3) from a base class)</ins>

          <li> &hellip;
      </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Change in 7.1.5 dcl.constexpr paragraph 5:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Add a new subclause after 12.6.2 class.base.init:
</p>
<blockquote class="ins">
<h3>12.6.3 Initialization by inherited constructor [class.inhctor.init]</h3>

<ol>
<li>

<p>
When a constructor for type <tt>B</tt> is invoked to initialize an object of
a different type <tt>D</tt> (that is, when the constructor was inherited (7.3.3)),
initialization proceeds as if a defaulted default constructor is used to initialize
the <tt>D</tt> object and each base class subobject from which the constructor was
inherited, except that the <tt>B</tt> subobject is initialized by the invocation
of the inherited constructor.
The complete initialization is considered to be a single function call; in
particular, the initialization of the inherited constructor's parameters is
sequenced before the initialization of any part of the <tt>D</tt> object.
[ Example:
<pre>
struct B1 {
  B1(int, ...) { }
};

struct B2 {
  B2(double) { }
};

int get();

struct D1 : B1 {
  using B1::B1;  // inherits B1(int, ...)
  int x;
  int y = get();
};

void test() {
  D1 d(2, 3, 4); // OK: B1 is initialized by calling B1(2, 3, 4),
                 // then d.x is default-initialized (no initialization is performed),
                 // then d.y is initialized by calling get()
  D1 e;          // error: D1 has no default constructor
}

struct D2 : B2 {
  using B2::B2;
  B1 b;
};

D2 f(1.0);       // error: B1 has no default constructor

struct W { W(int); };
struct X : virtual W { using W::W; X() = delete; };
struct Y : X { using X::X; };
struct Z : Y, virtual W { using Y::Y; };
Z z(0); // OK: initialization of Y does not invoke default constructor of X

template&lt;class T&gt; struct Log : T {
  using T::T;    // inherits all constructors from class T
  ~Log() { std::clog &lt;&lt; "Destroying wrapper" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }
};
</pre>
Class template <tt>Log</tt> wraps any class and forwards all of its constructors,
while writing a message to the standard log whenever an object of class
<tt>Log</tt> is destroyed.
]
</p>

<li>
<p>
If the constructor was inherited from multiple base class subobjects of type
<tt>B</tt>, the program is ill-formed.
[ Example:
<pre>
struct A { A(int); };
struct B : A { using A::A; };

struct C1 : B { using B::B; };
struct C2 : B { using B::B; };

struct D1 : C1, C2 {
  using C1::C1;
  using C2::C2;
};

struct V1 : virtual B { using B::B; };
struct V2 : virtual B { using B::B; };

struct D2 : V1, V2 {
  using V1::V1;
  using V2::V2;
};

D1 d1(0); // ill-formed: ambiguous
D2 d2(0); // OK: initializes virtual B base class, which initializes the A base class
          // then initializes the V1 and V2 base classes as if by a defaulted default constructor

struct M { M(); M(int); };
struct N : M { using M::M; };
struct O : M {};
struct P : N, O {};
P p(0); // OK: use M(0) to initialize N's base class,
        // use M() to initialize O's base class
</pre>
]
</p>

<em>Drafting note: This is intended to mirror the behavior when invoking a
non-static member function inherited from multiple base classes.</em>

<li>
<p>When an object is initialized by an inheriting constructor, the principal
constructor (12.6.2, 15.2) for the object is considered to have completed
execution when the initialization of all subobjects is complete.

</blockquote>

<p>
Do not change 15.2 except.ctor paragraph 3:
</p>
<blockquote>
For an object of class type of any storage duration whose initialization or destruction is terminated by an
exception, the destructor is invoked for each of the object's fully constructed subobjects, that is, for each
subobject for which the principal constructor (12.6.2) has completed execution
and the destructor has not yet begun execution,
except that in the case of destruction,
the variant members of a union-like class are not destroyed. &hellip;

</p>
<blockquote>
Similarly, if the <del>non-delegating</del><ins>principal</ins> constructor for an object has completed execution

<h1>Core Issue XXXX: ...</h1>

<p>
Change in 3.6.2 basic.start.init paragraph 4:
</p>

<blockquote>
It is implementation-defined whether the dynamic initialization of a non-local
variable with static storage duration is done before the first statement of
main.
<del>
If the initialization is deferred to some point in time after the first
statement of main, it shall occur before the first odr-use (3.2) of any
function or variable defined in the same translation unit as the variable to be
initialized.
</del>
<ins>
For a variable V with thread or static storage duration, let X be the set of
all variables with the same storage duration as V that are defined in the same
translation unit as V. If the observable behavior of the abstract machine (1.8
[intro.object]) depends on the value of V through an evaluation E,
and there is no variable in X the end of whose initialization happens after E,
<!--
and E is not
sequenced before the end of the initialization of any variable in X,
-->
then the
end of the initialization of all variables in X happens before E.
</ins>
[Footnote: A non-local variable with static storage duration
having initialization with side-effects must be initialized even if it is not
odr-used (3.2, 3.7.1).]

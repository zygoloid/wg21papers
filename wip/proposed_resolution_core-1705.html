<h1>Core Issue 1705: Unclear specification of "more specialized"</h1>

<p>
Change in 14.8.2.4 temp.deduct.partial paragraph 9:
</p>

<blockquote>
If, for a given type, deduction succeeds in both directions (i.e., the types
are identical after the transformations above) and both <tt>P</tt> and
<tt>A</tt> were reference types (before being replaced with the type referred
to above):

<ul>
<li>
if the type from the argument template was an lvalue reference and the type
from the parameter template was not,
<del>the argument type is considered to be more specialized than the other</del>
<ins>the parameter type is not considered to be at least as
specialized as the argument type</ins>; otherwise,

<li>
if the type from the argument template is more cv-qualified than the type from
the parameter template (as described above),
<del>the argument type is considered to be more specialized than the
other; otherwise,</del>
<ins>the parameter type is not considered to be at least as
specialized as the argument type.</ins>

<li>
<del>neither type is more specialized than the other.</del>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in 14.8.2.4 temp.deduct.partial paragraph 10:
</p>

<blockquote>
<del>
If for each type being considered a given template is at least as specialized
for all types and more specialized for some set of types and the other template
is not more specialized for any types or is not at least as specialized for any
types, then the given template is more specialized than the other template.
Otherwise, neither template is more specialized than the other.</del>

<ins>
Function template <tt>F</tt> is at least as specialized as function template
<tt>G</tt> if, for each pair of types used to determine the ordering, the type
from <tt>F</tt> is at least as specialized as the type from <tt>G</tt>.
<tt>F</tt> is more specialized than <tt>G</tt> if
<tt>F</tt> is at least as specialized as <tt>G</tt> and
<tt>G</tt> is not at least as specialized as <tt>F</tt>.
</ins>

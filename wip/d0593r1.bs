Motivating examples
===================

Idiomatic C code as C++
-----------------------

Consider the following natural C program:

```
struct X { int a, b; };
X *make_x() {
  X *p = (X*)malloc(sizeof(struct X));
  p->a = 1;
  p->b = 2;
  return p;
}
```

When compiled with a C++ compiler, this code has undefined behavior, because
`p->a` attempts to write to an `int` subobject of an `X` object, and this
program never created either an `X` object nor an `int` subobject.

Per [intro.object]p1,

<blockquote>
An *object* is created by a definition, by a *new-expression*, when
implicitly changing the active member of a union, or when a temporary
object is created.
</blockquote>

... and this program did none of these things.

Objects provided as byte representation
---------------------------------------

Suppose a C++ program is given a sequence of bytes (perhaps from disk or from a
network), and it knows those bytes are a valid representation of type `T`. How
can it efficiently obtain a `T *` that can be legitimately used to access the
object?

Example: (many details omitted for brevity)

```
void process(Stream *stream) {
  unique_ptr<char[]> buffer = stream->read();
  if (buffer[0] == FOO)
    process_foo(reinterpret_cast<Foo*>(buffer.get())); // #1
  else
    process_bar(reinterpret_cast<Bar*>(buffer.get())); // #2
}
```

This code leads to undefined behavior today: within `Stream::read`, no `Foo` or
`Bar` object is created, and so any attempt to access a `Foo` object through the
`Foo*` produced by the cast at #1 would result in undefined behavior.

Dynamic construction of arrays
------------------------------

Consider this program that attempts to implement a type like `std::vector`:

```
template<typename T> struct Vec {
  char *buf = nullptr, *buf_end_size = nullptr, *buf_end_capacity = nullptr;
  void reserve(std::size_t n) {
    char *newbuf = (char*)::operator new(n * sizeof(T), std::align_val_t(alignof(T)));
    std::uninitialized_copy(begin(), end(), (T*)newbuf); // #a

    ::operator delete(buf, std::align_val_t(alignof(T)));
    buf_end_size = newbuf + sizeof(T) * size(); // #b
    buf_end_capacity = newbuf + sizeof(T) * n;  // #c
    buf = newbuf;
  }
  void push_back(T t) {
    if (buf_end_size == buf_end_capacity)
      reserve(std::max<std::size_t>(size() * 2, 1));
    new (buf_end_size) T(t);
    buf_end_size += sizeof(T); // #d
  }
  T *begin() { return (T*)buf; }
  T *end() { return (T*)buf_end_size; }
  std::size_t size() { return end() - begin(); } // #e
};
int main() {
  Vec<int> v;
  v.push_back(1);
  v.push_back(2);
  v.push_back(3);
  for (int n : v) { /*...*/ } // #f
}
```

In practice, this code works across a range of existing implementations, but
according to the C++ object model, undefined behavior occurs at points #a, #b,
#c, #d, and #e, because they attempt to perform pointer arithmetic on a region
of allocated storage that does not contain an array object.

At locations #b, #c, and #d, the arithmetic is performed on a `char*`, and at
locations #a, #e, and #f, the arithmetic is performed on a `T*`. Ideally, a
solution to this problem would imbue both calculations with defined behavior.

Use of the value of `offsetof`
------------------------------

The C++ standard library provides an `offsetof` macro that permits the
determination of the byte offset from the start of a standard-layout class type
to a named member. However, there is no easy way to use the resulting value to
navigate within allocated storage:

```
struct X { int a; /*...*/ int n; };
const auto off = offsetof(X, n);
X x;
char *p = reinterpret_cast<char*>(&x); // #1
char *q = p + off;                     // #2
int *r = reinterpret_cast<int*>(q);    // #3
int *s = std::launder(r);              // #4
```

Here, step #1 is valid, and produces a `char*` that points to the `X` object.
Since the pointee type and the pointed-to object type are not compatible, this
pointer cannot actually be used to access the object.

Step #2 *results in undefined behavior*, because `char *p` does not point to an
array object, and pointer arithmetic is only defined on arrays.

If we assume that step #2 resulted in `q` representing the address of the
storage containing `x.n`, then step #3 is valid, and produces the same pointer
value (the only side-condition is that the pointer is suitably aligned, and
that side-condition is met).

Step #4 is valid, and obtains the desired pointer that actually points to the
`int` subobject of the `X` object.

Approach
========

Following discussion in SG12, the proposed approach has the following components:

  * We identify some array types as being "storage types". These are the types
    that can be used to hold arbitrary objects, for instance by placement new.
    C++17 already has some support for such types via the "provides storage"
    rules.
 
  * Allocation functions (in particular, `::operator new` and `std::malloc`)
    are modeled as implicitly creating an object of such a storage type
    within the returned storage.
 
  * We identify some types ("implicit object types") as being suitable for
    implicit object creation. These are the types for which we wish to permit
    objects to come into existence automatically.
 
  * When a program attempts to perform class member access on an implicit object
    type via a pointer to (an element of) a storage type, an object of the
    relevant type is implicitly created.
  
  * When a program attempts to perform array indexing on a pointer to an object
    that is not an array element, and the storage for that object is provided
    by some other array object that provides storage for a contiguous sequence
    of objects of the same type, the behavior is as if an array object contains
    those objects.

Each of these points will be covered in more detail below.

Abstract: The current redefinition rules for entities attached to the global module unnecessarily disallows some natural code patterns. We propose to relax these rules to permit the relevant code patterns.

Background {#background}
==========

In C++ code prior to C++20, interfaces are exposed by textual inclusion. This
results in definitions of the same entity appearing in multiple translation
units. We require (though unfortunately do not consistently enforce in
practice) that all such definitions are "the same". ("The same" is a complex
issue, but the details aren't salient to this paper.)

In addition, we require that there is at most one definition of each entity in
each translation unit. This requirement serves a number of purposes, notably:

  * it permits simpler implementations, as there is no need to cope with
    encountering a definition of an entity when another definition is already
    known

  * it ensures that compilation time is not wasted processing redundant
    redefinitions

    <div class=example>
    ```
    // foo.h -- user forgot the include guards
    struct X { int foo; };
    ```

    ```
    #include "foo.h"
    #include "foo.h" // error, redefinition
    ```
    </div>

  * it catches some bugs where there is an accidental name collision between
    two different entities of the same kind (eg, two different `struct X`s)

    <div class=example>
    ```
    // foo.h
    struct X { int foo; };
    ```

    ```
    // bar.h
    struct X { int bar; };
    ```

    ```
    #include "foo.h"
    #include "bar.h" // error, redefinition
    ```
    </div>

However, it is important to note that the requirement of only one definition
per translation unit is not necessary for the soundness of the language: the
requirement that all definitions are "the same" is sufficient. We could accept
example 1 and consider example 2 to be ill-formed (likely with no diagnostic
required), but it is preferable to reject such redefinition cases when there is
not a compelling reason to permit them.

In the current C++20 draft, we continue to allow multiple definitions of
entities that are attached to the global module (entities attached to named
modules can only have one definition). We now allow definitions to be made
reachable from translation units other than the one in which they are defined
(via various forms of `import`), and so in an attempt to preserve the above
useful properties to the extent possible, we disallow redefinition of an entity
if a prior definition is "necessarily reachable" -- which, for names attached
to the global module, means the definition can be found through a path of zero
or more `import` declarations, where each one other than the first is exported.

Note that this necessary reachability rule does not satisfy the first goal
above: implementations do need to cope with encountering a definition of an
entity when another definition is already known, because there are cases where
such a definition must be available to template instantiation in some contexts,
despite not being necessarily reachable. (In such cases, we might describe the
definition as "incidentally reachable", although the standard wording doesn't
use that term.)

<div class=example>
```
// foo.h
#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H
struct Foo {
  constexpr int get() const { return 42; }
};
#endif
```

```
// bar.h
#include "foo.h"
// ...
```

```
export module M;
import "bar.h";

export template<typename T> constexpr T make() {
  return T(Foo().get());
}
```

```
import M;

// OK, array bound is 42
// Note that make<int> can be instantiated and used here, even though Foo is
// not necessarily reachable from this context.
int arr[make<int>()];

// OK, definition of Foo is valid, because prior definition is not necessarily
// reachable in this context. (Note that the include guard macro FOO_H is not
// made visible by the import of M.)
#include "foo.h"
```
</div>

Problem {#problem}
=======

We permit entities attached to the global module to be made reachable through a
named module, in one of several ways:

```
module;
#include "a.h" // struct A {};
export module M;
export import "b.h"; // struct B {}; (in importable header)
export A f();
```

Here, the definitions of `A` and `B` are reachable in an importer of module
`M`:

  * `A` is reachable implicitly because it's used in the declaration of `f`
  * `B` is reachable explicitly because it's defined in an exported header unit

This re-export of entities attached to the global module divorces the entities
from their include guard macros, which exposes the possibiltiy that a consumer
of this module interface will encounter a redefinition error with the current
rule:

```
import M;
#include "a.h" // error, redefinition of A
#include "b.h" // OK, but see below
```

Due to the `#include` translation rule, the `#include "b.h"` directive is
translated to `import "b.h";` because `"b.h"` is an importable header, so
there is no redefinition error in that case. But this does not remove all risk:

```
// b-impl.h, not an importable header
#ifndef B_IMPL_H
#define B_IMPL_H
struct B {};
#endif
```

```
// b.h, importable header
#include "b-impl.h"
```

```
import M;
#include "b-impl.h" // error, redefinition of B
```

In both cases, disassociating the `#include` guard macro from the definitions
that it is guarding has removed the protection from redefinition errors that we
were traditionally relying upon.

Proposed solution {#proposal}
=================

Change the redefinition restriction as follows: for entities attached to the
global module, permit at most one definition per translation unit, regardless
of whether any definition of the entity is already reachable.

What we gain:

  * increased robustness in the presence of re-exportation of entities attached
    to the global module
  * a slightly simpler rule (we can entirely remove the notion of "necessarily
    reachable" and replace it with "in the same translation unit"
  * a rule that is in some sense closer to the pre-C++20 rule
  * a lower burden on implementations, as there is no longer any requirement to
    precisely track which definitions are necessarily reachable

What we lose:

  * in principle, there are some cases where we would previously have caught
    a name collision between two different definitions of the same type, and
    will no longer do so

Note that this change should apply to all constructs that are permitted to be
repeated across translation units but not within a single translation unit,
including redeclarations of default arguments and default template arguments
in addition to redefinitions of classes, functions, variables, and
enumerations.

Making `#include` translation optional {#proposal-translation}
--------------------------------------

Assuming the main proposal is accepted, there is another question we can now
consider: should we require implementations to perform `#include` translation
for all headers for which they would permit an `import`?

Previously, we required include translation in part in order to mitigate the
effects of the problem that is solved by this proposal. In the simple `b.h`
example above, `#include` translation saves us from a redefinition error unless
a definition in an imported header can also be found in a textual header.

With the acceptance of this proposal, we can reconsider whether we want to give
implementations the freedom to choose whether to map `#include` directives to
`import` declarations separately from choosing which header files are
importable. At least one implementation vendor believes that migration to
modules would be eased by permitting these two decisions to be decoupled.

We propose that implementations be permitted to choose not to perform
`#include` translation for importable headers.

Alternatives {#alternatives}
============

If we keep the current redefinition rule, we will need to ensure that current
header file techniques properly prevent redefinition. This would likely entail

  * exporting macros from named modules whenever any entity attached to the
    global module is exported
  * ensuring that export of entities from the global module has the same level
    of granularity as include guard macros (the export must be "all or nothing"
    because an include guard macro can't be half-defined)

If we do not wish to allow macro export from named modules and want to keep the
current rule for redefinitions, we conclude that we would need to disallow
re-exportation of entities attached to the global module entirely.

We don't consider any of the alternatives in this area to be acceptable, as
they would require us to give up important properties (the ability for a module
to export declarations from a non-modular library, or the guarantee that a
named module import does not bring in macros).

Implementation experience {#impl}
=========================

This approach has been implemented in the Microsoft compiler for 3+ years.

This approach has also been implemented in a branch of the Clang compiler, and
confirmed to fix the redefinition errors in the above examples.

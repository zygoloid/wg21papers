<h1>Relaxing constraints on <tt>constexpr</tt> functions</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The features of a programming language are more useful and easy to understand
if they are orthogonal, and can be naturally combined with one another.
<tt>constexpr</tt> functions currently carry a number of restrictions which
prevent their natural combination with many other language facilities (for
instance, <tt>for</tt> loops, variable modifications, exceptions, and so
on). Working around these restrictions often requires the sacrifice of
expressiveness.</p>

<p>This paper explores the removal of most of the restrictions on
<tt>constexpr</tt> function definitions, in order to make them a simpler and
more uniform extension of runtime C++ code. Idiomatic C++ code would be permitted
within <tt>constexpr</tt> functions, usually with no modification from its
non-<tt>constexpr</tt> form other than the addition of the <tt>constexpr</tt>
keyword.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Prior to <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3268.htm">N3268</a>,
the body of a <tt>constexpr</tt> function was required to be of the form</p>

<pre class="extract"><code>{ return <i>expression</i>; }</code></pre>

<p>N3268 loosened up the rules to allow (7.1.5/3):</p>

<blockquote class="std">
<ul><li>null statements,</li>
    <li><i>static_assert-declaration</i>s,</li>
    <li><tt>typedef</tt> declarations and <i>alias-declaration</i>s that do not
        define classes or enumerations,</li>
    <li><i>using-declaration</i>s,</li>
    <li><i>using-directive</i>s,</li>
    <li>and exactly one <code>return</code> statement.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>These restrictions on <tt>constexpr</tt> function definitions are still very
severe, and the relaxation of the rules has resulted in them becoming harder to
teach and to justify. Non-trivial <tt>constexpr</tt> functions tend to be
complex and to use a style of coding which is unfamiliar to many, because code
must be contorted to fit within the syntactic constraits.</p>

<p>Consider <tt>std::bitset&lt;N&gt;::all</tt>. Here is one possible
implementation:</p>

<pre class="extract"><code>template &lt;size_t N&gt;
bool bitset&lt;N&gt;::all() const noexcept {
  if (std::any_of(storage, storage + num_full_words, [] (word w) { return ~w; }))
    return false;
  if (num_full_words != num_words &amp;&amp; storage[num_full_words] != last_word_mask)
    return false;
  return true;
}</code></pre>

<p>This code is simple and idiomatic, and can make use of other library
components.  However, if we wish to make this function <tt>constexpr</tt>,
we must rewrite it:</p>

<pre class="extract"><code>constexpr bool any_unset(word *it, word *end) {
  return it == end ? false :
         ~*it ? true :
         any_unset(it + 1, end);
}

template &lt;size_t N&gt;
constexpr bool bitset&lt;N&gt;::all() const noexcept {
  return !any_unset(storage, storage + num_full_words) &amp;&amp;
         (num_full_words == num_words ||
          storage[num_full_words] == last_word_mask);
}</code></pre>

<p>This implementation suffers from several of the <tt>constexpr</tt>
restrictions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most of the algorithms in the standard library cannot be made
  <tt>constexpr</tt>, because iterators cannot be incremented in a
  <tt>constexpr</tt> function. We are forced to reimplement
  <tt>std::any_of</tt> to be <tt>constexpr</tt>-compatible.</li>
  <li>We cannot pass a lambda to our reimplementation, because lambdas
  are forbidden in <tt>constexpr</tt> functions.</li>
  <li><tt>for</tt> loops are forbidden, so we must use recursion to
  walk over the array.</li>
  <li><tt>if</tt> is forbidden, so we must use <tt>?:</tt>,
  <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, and <tt>||</tt> instead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>Discussion at Portland (October 2012) has identified that support for a
simple <tt>for</tt>-loop is a minimum requirement for a satisfactory relaxation
of the <tt>constexpr</tt> rules. This requirement can be attained in a number
of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Addition of a brand new looping construct to the language, which interacts
  well with the functional programming style required by <tt>constexpr</tt>.</li>

  <li>Allow a minimal feature set which supports the traditional C
  <tt>for</tt> statement. Since we wish for differing iterations of the loop
  to act differently, we require at least minimal support for mutation of
  local variables within an evaluated <tt>constexpr</tt> function. This could
  be restricted to the syntactic form
  <code class="extract">for (T var = <i>expr1</i>; var != <i>expr2</i>; ++var)</code>
  for a built-in integral type <tt>T</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>Allow a minimal feature set which supports the range-based for
  statement. An additional mechanism would be required to allow multiple
  iterations of the loop to communicate with each other. Such a loop could
  not be used with user-defined iterator types without further relaxing the
  language rules.</li>

  <li>Allow a coherent and broad subset of C++ to be used in <tt>constexpr</tt>
  functions, possibly all of C++.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first option risks further fracturing the C++ language into a
<tt>constexpr</tt> piece and a "rest of C++" piece. The second and third
options both require adding flow control and variable mutation to constant
expression evaluation, and would make the restrictions on <tt>constexpr</tt>
functions seem more arbitary than they do today. Therefore we consider the
final option in detail, and seek to identify an appropriate subset of C++
which improves simplicity of use without sacrificing simplicity of
implementation much beyond that required to support a for-loop.</p>

<h2>Proposed solution</h2>

<p>Promote <tt>constexpr</tt> to a largely unrestricted compile-time function
evaluation mechanism. There is implementation experience of such a mechanism in
the D programming language, where it is a popular feature (see the <a
href="http://dlang.org/function.html#interpretation">documentation</a> for this
feature). The programmer's model would become simple: <tt>constexpr</tt> allows
their code to run during compilation.</p>

<h3>Constant expressions</h3>

<p>An expression is a <i>constant expression</i> if evaluating it following
the rules of the C++ abstract machine succeeds without encountering
<ul>
  <li>globally-visible side-effects, such as modification of an object of static
  storage duration (other than the object being constructed, if any);</li>
  <li>expressions which cannot be evaluated during translation, such as
  dynamic memory allocation, comparisons with unspecified results and
  lvalue-to-rvalue conversions on objects which are neither constant nor
  created during the evaluation;</li>
  <li>non-portable constructs, such as an attempt to violate type-safety or
  to inspect the underlying storage of the abstract machine (for instance,
  through a <tt>reinterpret_cast</tt>), or use of inline <tt>asm</tt>;
  <li>invocation of a function which is not <tt>constexpr</tt>; or</li>
  <li>undefined behavior.</li>
</ul>
and if the resulting value is fully-initialized and does not contain any
references or pointers which denote temporaries, or objects with automatic,
dynamic, or thread storage duration.</p>

<p>C++11's <i>function invocation substitution</i> is not needed in this model.
Function invocations are instead handled as normal by the C++ abstract
machine.</p>

<p>Due to concerns over the simplicity of implementation, the evaluation of a
<i>lambda-expression</i>, a <i>throw-expression</i>, or the creation of an
object with a non-trivial destructor will continue to render an expression
non-constant.</p>

<h3>Object mutation within constant expressions</h3>

<p>Objects created within a constant expression can be modified within the
evalution of that constant expression (including the evaluation of any
<tt>constexpr</tt> function calls it makes), until the evaluation of that
constant expression ends, or the lifetime of the object ends, whichever
happens sooner. They cannot be modified by later constant expression
evaluations. Example:</p>

<pre class="extract"><code>constexpr int f(int a) {
  int n = a;
  ++n;                  // '++n' is not a constant expression
  return n * a;
}

int k = f(4);           // OK, this is a constant expression.
                        // 'n' in 'f' can be modified because its lifetime
                        // began during the evaluation of the expression.

constexpr int k2 = ++k; // error, not a constant expression, cannot modify
                        // 'k' because its lifetime did not begin within
                        // this expression.

struct X {
  constexpr X() : n(5) {
    n *= 2;             // not a constant expression
  }
  int n;
};
constexpr int g() {
  X x;                  // initialization of 'x' is a constant expression
  return x.n;
}
constexpr int k3 = g(); // OK, this is a constant expression.
                        // 'x.n' can be modified because the lifetime of
                        // 'x' began during the evaluation of 'g()'.
</code></pre>

<p>This approach allows arbitrary variable mutations within an evaluation, while
still preserving the essential property that constant expression evaluation
is independent of the mutable global state of the program. Thus a constant
expression evaluates to the same value no matter when it is evaluated, excepting
when the value is unspecified (for instance, floating-point calculations can
give different results and, with these changes, differing orders of evaluation
can also give different results).</p>

<p>The rules for use of objects whose lifetime did not begin within the
evaluation are unchanged: they can be read (but not modified) if either:
<ul>
<li>they are declared with <tt>constexpr</tt>, or
<li>they are <tt>const</tt> and of integral or unscoped enumeration type.
</ul></p>

<h3><tt>constexpr</tt> functions</h3>

<p>As in C++11, the <tt>constexpr</tt> keyword is used to mark functions
which the implementation is required to evaluate during translation, if they
are used from a context where a constant expression is required.
Any valid C++ code is permitted in <tt>constexpr</tt> functions, including
the creation and modification of local variables, and almost all statements,
with the restriction that it must be possible for a <tt>constexpr</tt> function
to be used from within a constant expression. A constant expression may still
have side-effects which are local to the evaluation and its result. For
instance:</p>

<pre class="extract"><code>constexpr int min(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; xs) {
  int min = std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max();
  for (int x : xs)
    if (x &lt; min)
      min = x;
  return min;
}

constexpr int fn(int a) {
  return a / (a - a); // ill-formed, no diagnostic required, never constant
}</code></pre>

<p>A handful of syntactic restrictions on <tt>constexpr</tt> functions are
retained:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>asm-declaration</i>s are not permitted.</li>
<li><i>try-block</i>s and <i>function-try-block</i>s are not permitted.</li>
<li>Declarations of variables with static and thread storage duration have some
restrictions (see below).</li>
</ul>

<h3><tt>constexpr</tt> constructors</h3>

<p>In any <tt>constexpr</tt> constructor, because the lifetime of the object under
construction began during the evaluation of the surrounding constant expression
(if any), the constructor and later parts of the evaluation are permitted to
modify its fields. Example:</p>

<pre class="extract"><code>struct lookup_table {
  int value[32];
  constexpr lookup_table() {
    for (int n = 0; n &lt; 32; ++n) {
      double x = n / 4;
      double f = x * std::cbrt(x) * std::pow(2, (n &amp; 3) * 0.25);
      value[n] = (int)(f * 1000000.);
    }
  }
  // OK, would be an error if implicit ~lookup_table was not constexpr.
  constexpr ~lookup_table() = default;
};
constexpr lookup_table table; // OK, table has constant initialization, and
                              // destruction is a constant expression.

struct override_raii {
  constexpr override_raii(int &amp;a, int v) : a(a), old(a) {
    a = v;
  }
  constexpr ~override_raii() {
    a = old;
  }
  int &amp;a, old;
};

constexpr int h(const lookup_table &amp;lut) { /* ... */ }
constexpr int f() {
  lookup_table lut;
  override_raii override(lut.value[4], 123);
  return h(lut);
  // OK, destructor runs here.
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Block-scope static local variables</h3>

<p>If a <tt>constexpr</tt> function contains a declaration of a variable of
static or thread storage duration, some additional restrictions are required
to prevent the evaluation from having side-effects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Such a variable must be initialized by a constant expression. This prevents
the initial value of the variable from depending on the order in which the
implementation chooses to evaluate <tt>constexpr</tt> function calls:

<pre class="extract"><code>constexpr int first_val(int n) {
  static int value = n; <i>// error: not a constant expression</i>
  return value;
}
const int N = first_val(5);
int arr[first_val(10)];
  </code></pre></li>

<li>The destructor of such a variable must be trivial.  This allows an
implementation to evaluate a <tt>constexpr</tt> function call at will, without
any concern about whether such evaluation causes a side-effect at program
termination.</li>

<li>Such a variable cannot be modified, even if its lifetime began
within the constant expression evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all other respects, such <tt>static</tt> or <tt>thread_local</tt>
variables can be used within <tt>constexpr</tt> functions in the same ways that
they could be used if they were declared outside the function. In particular,
they do not need to be <tt>constexpr</tt> nor have a literal type if their value
is not used:</p>

<pre class="extract"><code>constexpr mutex &amp;get_mutex(bool which) {
  static mutex m1, m2; <i>// non-const, non-literal, ok</i>
  if (which)
    return m1;
  else
    return m2;
}
</code></pre>


<h2>Possible additional features</h2>

<p>Some of the remaining restrictions on <tt>constexpr</tt> functions and
constant expression evaluation could be relaxed, if the value of the
language feature within a constant expression is thought to be sufficient
to justify the implementation cost:</p>

<h3><tt>constexpr</tt> destructors</h3>

<p>In most cases, in order to create an object of a type T in a constant
expression, the destruction of T must be trivial. However, non-trivial
destructors are an important component of modern C++, partly due to widespread
usage of the RAII idiom, which is also applicable in <tt>constexpr</tt>
evaluations. Non-trivial destructors could be supported in constant expressions,
as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow destructors to be marked as <tt>constexpr</tt></li>
  <li>Make defaulted destructors <tt>constexpr</tt> if they only invoke
  <tt>constexpr</tt> destructors</li>
  <li>For <tt>constexpr</tt> variables, require that evaluating the destructor
  is a constant expression (except that the object being destroyed may be
  modified in its own destructor</li>
</ul>

<p>However, no compelling use cases are known for such a feature, and there
would be a non-trivial implementation cost ensuring that destructors are run at
the right times.</p>

<h3>Lambdas</h3>

<p><a href=http://http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2859.pdf">N2859</a>
notes that severe implementation difficulties would arise if lambdas were
permitted in contexts which require their contents to be part of a mangled
name, and the prohibition on lambdas in constant expressions form part of
the resolution to those difficulties. Also, concerns have been raised about
the implementation cost of permitting lambdas in constant expressions, so
they are not proposed here.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>Throwing and catching exceptions within constant expression evalutations is
possible to support, but we do not know of a compelling use case for it, so it
is not proposed.</p>

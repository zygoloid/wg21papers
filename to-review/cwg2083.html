<h1>Core Issue 2083: Incorrect cases of odr-use</h1>
<h1>Core Issue 2103: Lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is irrelevant in odr-use of a reference</h1>
<h1>Core Issue 2170: Unclear definition of odr-use for arrays</h1>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>
When an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to an expression
that "obviously" denotes
an object that is usable in constant expressions
or a subobject thereof,
the intent is that there is no odr-use.
Instead, the implementation is expected
to directly use the value of that object.

<p>
This is non-trivial in the "or subobject thereof" case.
For example:

<pre>
struct A {
  int n;
  int m;
};
void f() {
  constexpr A a[3] = //...
  [](int n) {
    int k = a[n].m; // OK, not an odr-use of 'a', even though 'n' is unknown
  };
}
</pre>

<p>
Here, the value of <tt>k</tt> is not constant,
but the expression <tt>a[n].m</tt> still
satisfies our rules for not constituting an odr-use,
so no capture of <tt>a</tt> is necessary.

<p>
As we don't necessarily know which subobject we will need,
we check that all subobjects of <tt>a</tt> are constant.
Prior to DR1741, we phrased this as
<blockquote>
A variable x whose name appears as a potentially-evaluated expression ex is odr-used unless
x satisfies the requirements for appearing in a constant expression (7.7 [expr.const])
</blockquote>

<p>
DR1741 observed that this approach doesn't work
for the pathological case
where an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion
is applied directly to an object of class type,
which happens when passing an object of class type
through an ellipsis:
<pre>
  struct S { int n; };
  void f(...);
  void g() {
    constexpr S s = {};
    [] { f(s); }; // OK?
  }
</pre>
This resulted in a rephrasing as
<blockquote>
A variable x whose name appears as a potentially-evaluated expression ex is odr-used unless
applying the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (7.3.1 [conv.lval]) to x yields a constant expression (7.7 [expr.const]) that does not invoke any non-trivial functions
</blockquote>
... which intends to make the above case not result
in an odr-use of <tt>s</tt>.
The way this works is by inventing a copy construction
of an <tt>A</tt> from <tt>a</tt> in the class case,
and checking that copy construction is a constant expression.

<p>
The rewording caused a number of regressions:
<ul>
  <li>(DR2038) A synthetic and irrelevant copy construction is now
    performed for mentions of an object of class type:
    <pre>
template&lt;typename T> struct X { using Y = typename T::error; };
struct A {
  constexpr A() : n(0) {}
  template&lt;typename T> A(typename X&lt;T>::Y);
  int n;
};
constexpr A a = A();
int x = a.n; // ill-formed
    </pre>
    This example is ill-formed because the synthesized lvalue-to-rvalue conversion
    applied to <tt>a</tt> as part of determining whether <tt>a</tt> is odr-used
    triggers instantiation of <tt>X&lt;X></tt>.
  <li>(DR2103) An irrelevant lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to references
    when determining whether they are odr-used:
    <pre>
extern int globx;
int main() {
  const int &amp;x = globx;
  struct A {
   const int *foo() {
     return &amp;x; // should not be an odr-use but now is
   }
  } a;
  return *a.foo();
}
    </pre>
  <li>Copy-construction of an object of class type results in an odr-use,
    but lvalue-to-rvalue conversion of such an object (which is supposed
    to mean the same thing) does not.
    <pre>
    struct A { int n; };
    void f(...);
    void g(A);
    void h() {
      constexpr A a = {1};
      [] {
        f(a); // ok
        g(a); // ill-formed
      };
    }
    </pre>
</ul>

<p>
My conclusion is that the direction of issue 1741 is inappropriate,
and that we should instead treat direct lvalue-to-rvalue conversions
applied to objects of class type as resulting in odr-use.
(Notionally, a reference is bound to the object,
which is the canonical example of a mention that constitutes an odr-use.)

<p>
If we revert 1741, we reintroduce another issue:
the pre-1741 wording is insufficient to identify
the cases that require odr-use,
specifically when accessing volatile or mutable members.
For example, consider:

<pre>
struct A {
  mutable int n;
};
int f() {
  constexpr A a = {0};
  a.n = 1;
  return []{ return a.n; }();
}
</pre>

<p>The lambda does not odr-use <tt>a</tt>,
so (presumably) the constant initializer's value must be used,
which results in the function <tt>f</tt>
returning the wrong value. And:

<pre>
struct B {
  volatile int n;
};
int f() {
  constexpr B b = {0};
  return []{ return b.n; }();
}
</pre>

<p>The side-effect of the volatile access within the lambda
should be applied to the <tt>n</tt> member of the <tt>b</tt>
object, but will instead be applied to whatever synthetic
copy the compiler generates.

<p>
DR1741 addresses these issues by simulating a load from all
members of the object. However, this is overkill: it also
rules out cases like

<pre>
struct C {
  int a;
  mutable int b;
};
int f() {
  constexpr C c = {1, 2};
  c.b = 3;
  return []{ return c.a; }();
}
</pre>

<p>
... which is unproblematic, because we can trivially statically determine that
only a non-mutable member is being accessed.
One subtlety is that a mutable member access is not problematic
if followed by a const member access:

<pre>
struct X { const int n; };
struct D {
  mutable X x;
};
int f() {
  constexpr D d = {{1}};
  return []{ return d.x.n; }(); // error, could be accepted, d.x.n is not actually mutable
}
</pre>

<p>
Another subtlety is that the presence of 'mutable'
is irrelevant where the mention is in a discarded-value expression:

<pre>
int g() {
  constexpr D d = {{1}};
  [] { d.n; }; // ok, should not be an odr-use even though d is mutable
}
</pre>

Both situations suggest that we need to at least distinguish between
mutable and non-mutable access paths.

<p>
Another interesting case arises around union member accesses. Consider:

<pre>
union U {
  int a;
  int b;
};
void f() {
  constexpr U arr[] = { {.a=1}, {.b=2} };
  [] { return arr[0].b; }; // #1
  [] { return arr[1].b; }; // #2
  [] (int n) { return arr[n].b; }; // #3
}
</pre>

Here, the read at #1 is not a constant expression because it reads
an inactive union member. The read at #2 is a constant expression.
It is not obvious how to handle this; the current wording approach
suggests neither access being an odr-use, because copying the entire
array would be valid in a constant expression (despite the fact that
the actual wording doesn't work for this case because there is no
lvalue-to-rvalue conversion for array types).

<p>
If we follow the principle that an access is not an odr-use if
all possible "actual" access paths are constant expressions,
then we determine that #1 is an odr-use (and indeed is ill-formed
because <tt>arr</tt> is not captured), #2 is not an odr-use (and
an implementation would be expected to rewrite <tt>arr[1].b</tt>
as the constant <tt>2</tt>), and #3 is an odr-use because it might
refer to <tt>arr[0].b</tt>.

<p>
Another surprise in the current rules is that
a non-constant array index is permitted,
but a non-constant pointer to member is not:
<pre>
struct A {
  int n;
  int m;
};
void f() {
  constexpr A a[3] = //...
  constexpr int A::*n = &amp;A::n;
  [](int n, int A::*p) {
    int k1 = a[n].*n; // OK, not an odr-use of 'a'
    int k2 = a[1].*p; // error, odr-use of 'a'
  };
}
</pre>
It seems very hard to justify why these cases
should be treated differently.

<h1>Core Issue 1621: Member initializers in anonymous unions</h1>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
Consider the following example:
</p>

<pre>
  struct A {
    struct B {
      union {
        int x = 37;
      };
      union {
        int y = x + 47;  // Well-formed?
      };
    } a;
  };
</pre>

<p>
Does an anonymous union have a constructor that applies a non-static data
member initializer? Or is the initialization performed by the constructor of
the class in which the anonymous union appears? In particular, is the reference
to <tt>x</tt> in the initializer for <tt>y</tt> well-formed or not? If the
initialization of <tt>y</tt> is performed by <tt>B</tt>'s constructor, there is
no problem because <tt>B::x</tt> is a member of the object being initialized.
If an anonymous union has its own constructor, <tt>B::x</tt> is just a member
of the containing class and is a reference to a non-static data member without
an object, which is ill-formed. Implementations currently appear to take the
latter interpretation and report an error for that initializer.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We agreed that this case should be ill-formed: <tt>x</tt> cannot be referenced
from the anonymous union because the <tt>this</tt> pointer points to the
anonymous union and not to the <tt>B</tt> object. (See [expr.prim.this]p3.)

<p>
Careful reading indicates the example is already ill-formed:
the reference to <tt>x</tt> is rewritten as <tt>(*this).x</tt>,
but <tt>this</tt> points to the anonymous union,
so the member access is ill-formed.
(The Wording below cleans up some wording in this area,
but no change to the normative meaning is intended.)

<blockquote>
 As a further example, consider:

 <pre>
  union {       // #1
    union {     // #2
      union {   // #3
        int y = 32;
      };
    };
  } a { } ;
 </pre>

One interpretation might be that union #3 has a non-trivial default constructor because of the initializer of y, which would give union #2 a deleted default constructor, which would make the example ill-formed.
</blockquote>

It's unclear whether this example is valid at all; per [class.anon.union]p1:

<blockquote>
  [An anonymous union] defines an unnamed type and an unnamed object of that type called an anonymous union object.
  Each member-declaration in the member-specification of an anonymous union shall either define a non-static data member or be a static_assert-declaration.
  [Note: Nested types, anonymous unions, and functions cannot be declared within an anonymous union. -end note]
</blockquote>

Per the note, this example is invalid, but per the normative wording, it's
valid: as the first sentence indicates, the anonymous union declaration <em>does</em>
define a non-static data member.
There is implementation divergence on this question, but (eg) the wording for
defaulted special members and class properties does not in general take this
possibility into account. For example, in [class.default.ctor]/2.2 (emphasis
mine):

<blockquote>
  X is a non-union class that has a variant member M with a non-trivial default
  constructor and no variant member of <b>the anonymous union
  containing M</b> has a default member initializer,
</blockquote>

Core issue 1587 attempted to make this case ill-formed, but was not entirely
successful. The proposed wording clarifies that the above example is
ill-formed, by making the note normative.

<blockquote>
  As yet another example, consider:

  <pre>
  union {
    union {
      int x;
    };
    union {
      int y = 3;
    };
    union {
      int z;
    };
  } a { };
  </pre>

Assuming the current proposed resolution of issue 1502, what is the correct interpretation of this code? Is it well-formed, and if so, what initialization is performed?
</blockquote>

The example is well-formed and initializes <tt>a.y</tt> to <tt>3</tt>.
Per [dcl.init.aggr], there are no explicitly initialized elements, and by /5.4,
we use the default member initializser to initialize the union.
(This wording was clarified when designated initializers were introduced.)

<blockquote>
  Finally, consider

  <pre>
  struct S {
    union { int x = 1; };
    union { int y = 2; };
  } s{};
  </pre>

Does this violate the prohibition of aggregates containing member initializers in 9.3.1 [dcl.init.aggr] paragraph 1?
</blockquote>

There is no longer any such prohibition. It might be reasonable to informally
decide what behavior should apply for such cases, but we do not issue Defect
Reports against C++11, so there is no formal action to take. Informally I
suggest we consider such cases to be non-aggregates in C++11 mode, as that
matches the current behavior of all major implementations that have such a
mode.

<h2>Wording</h2>

<p>
Change in 11.3.2 class.mfct.non-static paragraph 1:
</p>

<blockquote>
[&hellip;] A non-static member function may also be called directly using the
function call syntax (7.6.1.2, 12.3.1.1) from within <del>the body of a member function of</del>
its class or <del>of</del> a class derived from its class<ins>, or a member thereof, as described below</ins>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in 11.3.2 class.mfct.non-static paragraph 3:
</p>

<blockquote>
When an <i>id-expression</i> (7.5.4)
that is not part of a class member access syntax (7.6.1.4)
and not used to form a pointer to member (7.6.2.1)
is used in a member of class <tt>X</tt>
in a context where <tt>this</tt> can be used (7.5.2),
if name lookup (6.4) resolves the name in the <i>id-expression</i>
to a non-static non-type member of some class <tt>C</tt>,
and if either the <i>id-expression</i> is potentially evaluated
or <tt>C</tt> is <tt>X</tt> or a base class of <tt>X</tt>,
the <i>id-expression</i> is transformed into a class member access expression (7.6.1.4)
using <tt>(*this)</tt> (11.3.2.1) as the <i>postfix-expression</i>
to the left of the <tt>.</tt> operator.
[<i>Note</i>:
If <tt>C</tt> is not <tt>X</tt> or a base class of <tt>X</tt>,
the class member access expression is ill-formed.
&mdash;<i>end note</i>]
<del>
Similarly during name lookup, when an unqualified-id (7.5.4.1) used in the
definition of a member function
for class X resolves to a static member, an
enumerator or a nested type of class X or of a base class of X, the
unqualified-id is transformed into a qualified-id (7.5.4.2) in which the
nested-name-specifier names the class of the member function.
</del>
<del>These</del><ins>This</ins> transformation<del>s do</del> <ins>does</ins> not apply in the template definition context (13.7.2.1).
[&hellip;]
</blockquote>

<p>
Delete 11.3.8 class.static paragraph 3:
</p>

<blockquote>
<del>
If an <i>unqualified-id</i> (7.5.4.1)
is used in the definition of a static member
following the member's <i>declarator-id</i>,
and name lookup (6.4.1) finds that the <i>unqualified-id</i>
refers to a static member, enumerator, or nested type of the member's class
(or of a base class of the member's class),
the <i>unqualified-id</i> is transformed
into a <i>qualified-id</i> expression
in which the <i>nested-name-specifier</i>
names the class scope from which the member is referenced.
[<i>Note</i>:
See 7.5.4 for restrictions on the use of non-static data members and non-static member functions.
&mdash;<i>end note</i>]
</del>
</blockquote>

<i>Drafting note: in CWG discussion we determined that the above wording appears to have no normative effect.</i>

<p>
Change in 11.4.1 class.anon.union paragraph 1:
</p>

<blockquote>
  [An anonymous union] defines an unnamed type and an unnamed object of that type called an anonymous union object.
  Each member-declaration in the member-specification of an anonymous union shall either define a non-static data member or be a static_assert-declaration.
  <del>[Note:</del> Nested types, anonymous unions, and functions <del>cannot</del> <ins>shall not</ins> be declared within an anonymous union. <del>-end note]</del>

<h1>Features SG: Wording for __has_include</h1>

<p>The following wording describes Clang's <tt>__has_include</tt> extension.</p>

<blockquote class="numbered">
<h2>The has-include operator</h2>

<p>The implementation shall define the macro name <tt>__has_include</tt> as an
object-like macro that expands to a <em>has-include</em> preprocessing token.
This preprocessing token is distinct from all other preprocessing tokens.</p>

<p>The <em>has-include</em> preprocessing token shall only appear within a
<em>has-include-expression</em>.
<pre class="grammar">
  <em>h-preprocssing-token:</em>
          any <em>preprocessing-token</em> other than <tt>&gt;</tt>
  <em>h-pp-tokens:</em>
          <em>h-preprocessing-token</em>
          <em>h-pp-tokens</em> <em>h-preprocessing-token</em>
  <em>has-include-expression:</em>
          <em>has-include</em> <tt>( </tt><em>header-name</em><tt> )</tt>
          <em>has-include</em> <tt>( </tt><em>string-literal</em><tt> )</tt>
          <em>has-include</em> <tt>( &lt;</tt> <em>has-include-pp-tokens</em> <tt>&gt; )</tt>
</pre>
In the first form of the <em>has-include-expression</em>, the parenthesized
<em>header-name</em> token is not subject to macro expansion. The second and
third forms are only considered if the first form does not match, and the
preprocessing tokens are processed just as in normal text.

<p>
A <em>has-include</em> preprocessing token shall only appear in the
controlling constant expression of a
<tt>#if</tt> or <tt>#elif</tt> directive ([cpp.cond] 16.1).

Prior to the evaluation of such an expression,
the source file identified by the parenthesized preprocessing token sequence
in each contained <em>has-include-expression</em>
is searched for as if those tokens were the <em>pp-tokens</em> in a
<tt>#include</tt> directive, except that no further macro expansion is
performed.

If such a directive would not satisfy the
syntactic requirements of a <tt>#include</tt> directive,
the program is ill-formed.

The <em>has-include-expression</em> is replaced
by the <em>pp-number</em> <tt>1</tt> if the search for the source file succeeds, and
by the <em>pp-number</em> <tt>0</tt> if the search fails.</p>

<p>[&nbsp;<em>Example:</em>
<pre>
#ifdef __has_include
#  if __has_include &lt;optional&gt;
#    include &lt;optional&gt;
#    define have_optional
#  endif
#endif
</pre>

can be used to portably include <tt>&lt;optional&gt;</tt> only if it is
available.
&mdash;&nbsp;<em>end&nbsp;example</em>&nbsp;]

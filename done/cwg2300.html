<h1>Core Issue 2300: Lambdas in multiple definitions</h1>

<p>
Change in 6.2 basic.def.odr paragraph 12:
</p>

<blockquote>
[&hellip;]
Given such an entity named D defined in more than one translation unit, then
<ul>
<li>
each definition of D shall consist of the same sequence of tokens<ins>,
for which the definition of a closure type is considered to consist of
the sequence of tokens of the corresponding <i>lambda-expression</i></ins>; and

<li>
in each definition of D, corresponding names, looked up according to 6.4,
<del>shall refer to an entity defined within the definition of D, or</del>
shall refer to the same entity,
after overload resolution (11.3) and
after matching of partial template specialization (12.9.3),
except that a name can refer to
<ul>
a non-volatile const object with internal or no linkage if the object
<ul>
<li>has the same literal type in all definitions of D,
<li>is initialized with a constant expression (7.7),
<li>is not odr-used in any definition of D, and
<li>has the same value in all definitions of D,
</ul>
or
<li>
a reference with internal or no linkage
initialized with a constant expression
such that the reference refers to the same entity in all definitions of D;
</ul>
and

<li>
<ins>
in each definition of D,
except within the default arguments
and default template arguments of D,
corresponding <i>lambda-expression</i>s
shall have the same closure type (see below), and
</ins>

<li>
[&hellip;]

<li>
in each definition of D,
the overloaded operators referred to,
the implicit calls to conversion functions, constructors,
operator new functions and operator delete functions,
shall refer to the same function<del>, or to a function defined within the definition of D</del>; and

<li>
in each definition of D,
a default argument used by an (implicit or explicit) function call
<ins>or a default template argument used by an (implicit or explicit) <i>template-id</i> or <i>simple-template-id</i></ins>
is treated as if its token sequence were present in the definition of D;
that is, the default argument <ins>or default template argument</ins> is subject to the requirements described in this paragraph
(<del>and, if the default argument has subexpressions with default arguments, this requirement applies </del>recursively)
<del>[Footnote: 9.2.3.6 describes how default argument names are looked up.]</del>; and

<li>
[&hellip;]
</ul>
If D is a template and is defined in more than one translation unit,
then the preceding requirements shall apply
both to names from the template's enclosing scope used in the template definition (12.7.3),
and also to dependent names at the point of instantiation (12.7.2).
<ins>
These requirements also apply to corresponding entities 
defined within each definition of <tt>D</tt> (including the
closure types of <i>lambda-expression</i>s, but excluding
entities defined within default arguments or default template arguments
of either <tt>D</tt> or an entity not defined within <tt>D</tt>).
For each such entity and for <tt>D</tt> itself, 
the behavior is as if there is a single entity with a single definition, 
including in the application of these requirements to other entities.
</ins>
<del>
If the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements,
then the behavior is as if there were a single definition of D.
</del>
[Note: The entity is still declared in multiple translation units,
and 6.5 still applies to these declarations.
In particular, lambda-expressions (7.5.5) appearing in the type of D
may result in the different declarations having distinct types<ins>,
and <i>lambda-expression</i>s appearing in a default argument
of D may still denote different types in different translation units</ins>. &mdash; end note]
If the definitions of D do not satisfy these requirements,
then the <del>behavior is undefined</del>
<ins>program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required</ins>.
<ins>
[Example:
<pre>
inline void f(bool cond, void (*p)()) {
  if (cond) f(false, []{});
}
inline void g(bool cond, void (*p)() = []{}) {
  if (cond) g(false);
}
struct X {
  void h(bool cond, void (*p)() = []{}) {
    if (cond) h(false);
  }
}
</pre>
If the definition of <tt>f</tt> appears in multiple translation units,
the behavior of the program is as if there is only one definition of <tt>f</tt>.
If the definition of <tt>g</tt> appears in multiple translation units,
the program is ill-formed (no diagnostic required) because each such definition
uses a default argument that refers to a distinct <i>lambda-expression</i>
closure type.
The definition of <tt>X</tt> can appear in multiple translation units of a valid program;
the <i>lambda-expression</i>s defined within
the default argument of <tt>X::h</tt> within the definition of <tt>X</tt>
denote the same closure type in each translation unit.
&mdash; end example]
</ins>

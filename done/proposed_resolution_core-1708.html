<h1>Core Issue 1708: overly-strict requirements for names with C language linkage</h1>

<p>
Change in 7.5 dcl.link paragraph 6:
</p>

<blockquote>
At most one function with a particular name can have C language linkage. Two
declarations for a function with C language linkage with the same function name
(ignoring the namespace names that qualify it) that appear in different
namespace scopes refer to the same function. Two declarations for a variable
with C language linkage with the same name (ignoring the namespace names that
qualify it) that appear in different namespace scopes refer to the same
variable. An entity with C language linkage shall not be declared with the same
name as <del>an entity</del><ins>a variable</ins> in global scope, unless both
declarations denote the same
entity; no diagnostic is required if the declarations appear in different
translation units. A variable with C language linkage shall not be declared with
the same name as a function with C language linkage (ignoring the namespace
names that qualify the respective names); no diagnostic is required if the
declarations appear in different translation units.
[&nbsp;<em>Note:</em> &hellip;&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;<em>Example:</em> &hellip;&nbsp;]

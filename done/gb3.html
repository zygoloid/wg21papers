<h1>NB Comment GB 3: Access and lookup of <em>init-capture</em>s</h1>
<h1>Core issue 1681: <em>init-capture</em>s and nested lambdas</h1>

<p>
Change in 5.1.2 expr.prim.lambda paragraph 11:
</p>

<blockquote>
<del>
For every <em>init-capture</em>
a non-static data member
named by the <em>identifier</em> of the <em>init-capture</em>
is declared in the closure type.
This member is not a bit-field and not <tt>mutable</tt>.
The type of that member corresponds to
the type of a hypothetical
</del>
<ins>
An <em>init-capture</em> behaves as if
it declares
and explicitly captures a
</ins>
variable <del>declaration</del> of the form
"<tt>auto</tt> <em>init-capture</em> <tt>;</tt>"
<ins>whose declarative region is the <em>lambda-expression</em>'s
<em>compound-statement</em>
</ins>, except that<del>
the variable name (i.e., the <em>identifier</em> of the <em>init-capture</em>) is replaced by a unique identifier.
</del>
<ins>:
<li>if the capture is by copy (see below),
the non-static data member
declared for the capture
and
the variable
are treated as two
different ways of referring to the same object, which has the lifetime
of the non-static data member, and no additional copy
and destruction is performed, and</li>
<li>if the capture is by reference, the variable's lifetime
ends when the closure object's lifetime ends.</li>
</ul>
</ins>
[&nbsp;<em>Note:</em>
This enables an <em>init-capture</em> like
"<tt>x = std::move(x)</tt>"; the second "<tt>x</tt>"
must bind to a declaration in the surrounding context.
&mdash;&nbsp;<em>end note</em>&nbsp;]
<del>
No entity is captured by an <em>init-capture</em>.
Within
the <em>lambda-expression</em>s
<em>lambda-declarator</em> and
<em>compound-statement</em>,
the identifier in the <em>init-capture</em> hides any declaration of the same name in scopes
enclosing the <em>lambda-expression</em>.</del>
[&nbsp;<em>Example:</em> &hellip; ]
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in 5.1.2 expr.prim.lambda paragraph 15:
</p>

<blockquote>
An entity is <em>captured by copy</em> if it is implicitly captured and the
<em>capture-default</em> is <tt>=</tt> or if it is explicitly
captured with a capture that
<del>
does not include an &amp;
</del>
<ins>
is not of the form &amp; <em>identifier</em> or &amp; <em>identifier</em>
<em>initializer</em></ins>. &hellip;
</blockquote>

<p><i>Drafting note: this excludes the case where the <tt>&amp;</tt> is within an
init-capture's initializer.</i></p>

<p>
Change in 5.1.2 expr.prim.lambda paragraph 18:
</p>

<blockquote>
Every <em>id-expression</em>
<ins>
within the <em>compound-statement</em> of a <em>lambda-expression</em>
</ins>
that is an odr-use (3.2) of an entity captured by copy is
transformed into an access to the
corresponding unnamed data member of the closure type. &hellip;

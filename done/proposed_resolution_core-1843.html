<h1>Core Issue 1843: Bit-field in conditional operator with <tt>throw</tt>
operand</h1>

<p>
Change in 5.16 expr.cond paragraph 2:
</p>

<blockquote>
If either the second or the third operand has type <tt>void</tt>,
one of the following shall hold:
<ul>
<li>
The second or the third operand (but not both) is a (possibly parenthesized)
<em>throw-expression</em> (15.1); the result is of the type and value category
of the other
<ins>operand. The <em>conditional-expression</em> is a bit-field if that
operand is a bit-field</ins>.
<li>&hellip;
</ul>
</blockquote>

<em>Drafting note: the above edit conflicts with the edits made by core issue
1299. The following change should be used if core issue 1299 has already been
applied:</em>

<blockquote>
<ul><li>
The second or the third operand (but not both) is a (possibly parenthesized)
<em>throw-expression</em> (15.1); the result is of the type and value category
of the other operand. The <em>conditional-expression</em> is a temporary
expression if that operand is a temporary expression
<ins>and is a bit-field if that operand is a bit-field</ins>.

<h1>Core Issue 1652: Object addresses in constexpr expressions</h1>

<p>
Change in 5.10 expr.eq paragraph 2:
</p>

<blockquote>
If at least one of the operands is a pointer, pointer conversions (4.10) and
qualification conversions (4.4) are performed on both operands to bring them to
their composite pointer type (Clause 5). Comparing pointers is defined as
follows:
<ul>
<li>
<ins>
If one pointer represents the address of a complete object, and another pointer
represents the address one past the last element of a different complete object
[Footnote: An object that is not an array element is considered to belong to a
single-element array for this purpose; see 5.3.1. -- end footnote], the result
of the comparison is unspecified.
</ins>
<li><ins>Otherwise, 
</ins>
<del>Two pointers compare equal</del> if <del>they</del><ins>the pointers</ins> are both null, both
point to the same function, or both represent the same address (3.9.2),
<ins>they compare equal.</ins>
<ins><li>Otherwise<del> they</del><ins>, the pointers</ins> compare unequal.</ins>
</ul>

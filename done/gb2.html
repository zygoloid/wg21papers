<h1>NB Comment GB 2: uninitialized "unsigned char" has defined value</h1>

<p>Change in 3.3.2 basic.scope.pdecl paragraph 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...
[&nbsp<em>Example</em>:
<pre>
<del>int</del><ins>unsigned char</ins> x = 12;
{ <del>int</del><ins>unsigned char</ins> x = x; }
</pre>

Here the second <tt>x</tt> is initialized with its own (indeterminate) value. ]
</blockquote>

<p>Change in 4.1 conv.lval paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li> ... </li>

<li>
<del>Otherwise, if <tt>T</tt> is a (possibly cv-qualified) unsigned
character type (3.9.1), and the object to which the glvalue refers contains an
indeterminate value (5.3.4, 8.5, 12.6.2),

and that object does not have automatic storage duration
or the glvalue was the operand of a unary <tt>&amp;</tt> operator or it was
bound to a reference, the result is an unspecified value.
[&nbsp;<em>Footnote:</em> The value may be
different each time the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to the object.
An <tt>unsigned char</tt> object with indeterminate value allocated to a
register might trap.&nbsp;]
</del>
</li>

<li>
<del>
Otherwise, if
<!--<ins><tt>T</tt> is not a (possibly cv-qualified) unsigned narrow
character type (3.9.1), and</ins>-->
the object to which the glvalue refers
contains an indeterminate value, the behavior is undefined.
</del>
</li>

<li>
Otherwise, the value contained in the object indicated by the glvalue is the
prvalue result.
</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Change in 5.3.4 expr.new paragraph 17:</p>

<blockquote>
A <em>new-expression</em> that creates an object of type <tt>T</tt> initializes
that object as follows:

<ul>
<li>If the <em>new-initializer</em> is omitted, the object is
default-initialized (8.5)<del>; if</del><ins>. [&nbsp;<em>Note:</em> If</ins> no
initialization is performed, the object has <ins>an</ins> indeterminate
value. <ins>]</ins>
<li>Otherwise ...
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Change in 8.5 dcl.init paragraph 12:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If no initializer is specified for an object, the object is
default-initialized<del>; if no initialization is performed,
an</del><ins>.
When storage for an</ins>
object with
automatic or dynamic storage duration
<ins>is obtained, the object</ins>
has <del>indeterminate value</del>
<ins>an <em>indeterminate value</em>, and if no initialization is performed
for the object, that object retains an indeterminate value until that value
is replaced (5.17)</ins>.
[ Note ... ]
<!--
</p>

<p>Add a new paragraph after 8.5 dcl.init paragraph 12:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
-->
<ins>
If an indeterminate value is produced by an evaluation, the behavior is
undefined except in the following cases:
</p><ins>
<ul>
<li>
If an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type (3.9.1) is produced
by the evaluation of:

<ul>
<li>the second or third operand of a conditional expression (5.16),
<li>the right operand of a comma (5.18),
<li>the operand of a cast or conversion to an unsigned narrow character type
(4.7, 5.2.3, 5.2.9, 5.4), or
<li>a discarded-value expression (Clause 5),
</ul>

then the result of the operation is an indeterminate value.

<li>
If an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type (3.9.1) is produced
by the evaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator (5.17)
whose first operand is an lvalue of unsigned narrow character type, an
indeterminate value replaces the value of the object referred to by the left
operand.

<li>
If an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type (3.9.1) is produced
by the evaluation of the initialization expression when initializing
an object of unsigned narrow character type, that object is initialized to an
indeterminate value.
</ul>

[&nbsp;<em>Example:</em>
<pre>
int f(bool b) {
  unsigned char c;
  unsigned char d = c; // ok, d has an indeterminate value
  int e = d;           // undefined behavior
  return b ? d : 0;    // undefined behavior if b is true
}
</pre>
&nbsp;]
</ins>

</blockquote>

<p>Change in 12.6.2 class.base.init paragraph 8:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... An attempt to initialize more than one non-static data member of a union
renders the program ill-formed.
<ins>[&nbsp;<em>Note:</em></ins>
After the call to a constructor for a class <tt>X</tt>
<ins>for an object with automatic or dynamic storage duration</ins>
has completed, if
<ins>the constructor was not invoked as part of value-initialization and</ins>
a member of <tt>X</tt> is neither initialized nor given a value during execution
of the <em>compound-statement</em> of the body of the constructor, the member
has <ins>an</ins> indeterminate value.
<ins>]</ins>
[&nbsp;<em>Example:</em> ... ]

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>
We propose the addition of an attribute, <tt>[[no_unique_address]]</tt> to
indicates that a unique address is not required for an non-static data member
of a class. A non-static data member with this attribute may share its address
(or its tail padding) with another object, if it could when used as a base class.

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<details>
<summary>
Q: Does this allow multiple subobjects <i>of the same type</i> to have the same address?
</summary>

No. Just like with base classes, if two members are of the same type or have subobjects of the same type, the common subobjects will be given distinct addresses.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Q: Can a standard library switch from EBO to this attribute without an ABI break?
</summary>

The intent is that an ABI can specify the same layout rule for a member with the attribute as it does for a base class. In an ABI that makes that choice, yes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Q: Does this allow reuse of tail padding? (Eg, three bytes at the end of <tt>struct A { int n; char c; };</tt>)
</summary>

The general rule is that the layout is just like for a base class. Tail padding reuse is permitted for base classes, so it's also permitted for members with the attribute.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Q: When is a type using this attribute considered "empty"? (As visible via <tt>std::is_empty</tt>)
</summary>

This is up to the ABI, so it will be implementation-defined whether a type is considered empty if it has no data members (transitively) other than those marked by the attribute.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Q: Does the attribute affect whether a type is standard-layout?
</summary>

No.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Q: Does the attribute affect the "common initial sequence" rule?
</summary>

Yes. For two <tt>struct</tt>s to be considered to have a common initial sequence, their initial sequences of common members must make consistent use of the attribute.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Q: Suppose I have members <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, <tt>c</tt> (in that order, with the same access).
Today we guarantee that <tt>&amp;a</tt> &lt; <tt>&amp;b</tt> &lt; <tt>&amp;c</tt>.
What happens if <tt>b</tt> has the attribute?
</summary>

Two cases:

<ol>
<li>If the type of <tt>b</tt> is empty, then there is no guarantee about the address of <tt>b</tt> (other than that it is somewhere within the containing object).
<li>If the type of <tt>b</tt> is nonempty, then we still guarantee that <tt>&amp;a</tt> &lt; <tt>&amp;b</tt> &lt; <tt>&amp;c</tt>.
</ol>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Q: Applying a <tt>[[no_unique_address]]</tt> attribute to a function, constant variable, etc, could be used to permit ICF ("Identical Code Folding" / "Identical Constant Folding" / "Identical COMDAT Folding"). Is this proposed?
</summary>

Not as part of this proposal.
</details>

<h2>Wording</h2>

<p>
Add a new paragraph before [intro.object] (4.5) paragraph 7:
</p>

<blockquote class="stdins">
A <i>potentially-overlapping subobject</i>
is either:
<ul>
<li>
  a base class subobject, or
<li>
  a bit-field ([class.bit]), or
<li>
  a non-static data member declared with the <tt>no_unique_address</tt> attribute ([dcl.attr.nouniqueaddr]).
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in [intro.object] (4.5) paragraph 7:
</p>

<blockquote class="std">
Unless it is a
<ins>potentially-overlapping subobject, an</ins>
<del>bit-field (12.2.4), a most derived</del>
object shall have a nonzero
size and shall occupy one or more bytes of storage.
<del>Base class</del>
<ins>It is implementation-defined whether potentially-overlapping</ins>
subobjects
<del>may</del> have zero size<ins>,
except that such a subobject does not have zero size if
it is a bit-fields with nonzero length or
has any
subobjects of nonzero size,
virtual member functions, or virtual base classes,
and that such a subobject has zero size if it is
a base class subobject of a standard-layout
class type that has neither non-static data members nor bit-fields</ins>.
An object of trivially copyable or standard-layout type (6.9)
shall occupy contiguous bytes of storage.
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in [intro.object] (4.5) paragraph 8:
</p>

<blockquote class="std">
Unless an object is a
bit-field or a <del>base class</del> <ins>potentially-overlapping</ins> subobject of zero size,
the address of that object is the address of the first byte it occupies.
Two objects <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> with overlapping lifetimes
<del>that are not bit-fields</del>
may have the same address if one is nested within the other, or if
at least one is a <del>base class</del> <ins>potentially-overlapping</ins> subobject
of zero size and they are of different types; otherwise, they have distinct addresses.
[Footnote] [Example]
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in [expr.sizeof] (8.3.3) paragraph 2:
</p>

<blockquote class="std">
When applied to a reference or a reference type,
the result is the size of the referenced type.
When applied to a class,
the result is the number of bytes in an object of that class
including any padding required for placing objects of that type in an array.
The size of a most derived class shall be greater than zero (4.5).
The result of applying <tt>sizeof</tt>
to a <del>base class</del> <ins>potentially-overlapping</ins> subobject
is the size of the <del>base class</del> type.
[ Footnote:
The actual size of a <del>base class</del> <ins>potentially-overlapping</ins> subobject
may be less than the result of applying <tt>sizeof</tt> to the subobject,
due to virtual base classes and less strict padding requirements on <del>base class</del>
<ins>potentially-overlapping</ins> subobjects. ]
When applied to an array, the result is the total
number of bytes in the array. This implies that the size of an array of n
elements is n times the size of an element.
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in [expr.rel] (8.9) paragraph 3:
</p>

<blockquote class="std">
Comparing unequal pointers to objects is defined as follows:
<ul>
<li>[&hellip;]
<li>If two pointers point to different non-static data members of the same object,
or to subobjects of such members, recursively, the pointer to the later declared
member compares greater provided the two members have the same access control (Clause 14)<ins>,
neither member is a subobject of zero size,</ins>
and <del>provided</del> their class is not a union.
<li>Otherwise, neither pointer compares greater than the other.
</blockquote>

<p>
Add a new subclause [dcl.attr.nouniqueaddr] after [dcl.attr.noreturn]:
</p>

<blockquote class="stdins">
<h3>10.6.9 No unique address attribute [dcl.attr.nouniqueaddr]</h3>

<p>
The <i>attribute-token</i> <tt>no_unique_address</tt>
specifies that a non-static data member need not have an
address distinct from all other non-static data members
of its class.
It shall appear at most once in each <i>attribute-list</i>
and no <i>attribute-argument-clause</i> shall be present.
The attribute may appertain to a non-static data member
other than a bit-field.
</p>

<p>
[ <i>Note</i>: The non-static data member can share the address
of another non-static data member of that of a base class,
and any padding that would normally be inserted at the
end of the object can be reused as storage for other
members. &mdash; <i>end note</i> ] [ <i>Example</i>:
<pre>
template&lt;typename Key, typename Value,
         typename Hash, typename Pred, typename Allocator>
class hash_map {
  [[no_unique_address]] Hash hasher;
  [[no_unique_address]] Pred pred;
  [[no_unique_address]] Allocator alloc;
  Bucket *buckets;
  // ...
public:
  // ...
};
</pre>

Here, <tt>hasher</tt>, <tt>pred</tt>, and <tt>alloc</tt> could have the same
address as <tt>buckets</tt> if their respective types are all empty.
&mdash; <i>end example</i> ]
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in [class] (12) paragraph 4:
</p>

<blockquote class="std">
<del>Complete objects and member subobjects of class type shall have nonzero size.</del>
[ Note: ... ]
</blockquote>

<p>
Change in [class.mem] (12.2) paragraph 21:
</p>

<blockquote class="std">
The <i>common initial sequence</i> of two standard-layout struct (Clause 12) types
is the longest sequence of non-static data members and bit-fields in declaration order,
starting with the first such entity in each of the structs,
such that corresponding entities have layout-compatible types<ins>,
either neither entity is declared with the <tt>no_unique_address</tt> attribute ([dcl.attr.nouniqueaddr]]) or both are,
and</ins> and either neither entity is a bit-field or both are bit-fields with the same width.

<p>
Change in [meta.unary.prop] (23.15.4.3) Table 42 ("Type property predicates"):
